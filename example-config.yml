field_mapping:
  # This is the full mapping of the assumed HFP fields and their respective
  # column indices (0-based!) in the csv files.
  # Tailor your output csv fields by only including the fields you want
  # putting them here in the order you want the fields in the output files,
  # and naming the fields as you want,
  # just make sure you refer to correct indices in the original csv.
  # If an entry only contains index: name, then it is left as string.
  # Otherwise, name and target type must be defined separately.
  # Possible target types are int, float, timestamp and date.
